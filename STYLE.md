# Style Guide

## Markdown

Use [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint). There's a nice [plugin
for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/linter-markdownlint). Have a look at the [default
style rules](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#rules--aliases). These
rules are selected for readability of source code compatibility with GitHub
wiki features.

### HTML

Please refrain from using HTML inside markdown files, as a rule. Sometimes,
using HTML is the only way to accomplish something, like including an image with
a custom width attribute.
